# Odinbook

Odin Project's final project. The goal is to create facebook clone using javascript and the MERN stack. The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.JS. The assignment is listed on the [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-odin-book) website.

[<span style="color: green">M</span>ongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database.<br>
[<span style="color: orange">E</span>xpress](https://expressjs.com/) as the sever framework in javascript.<br>
[<span style="color: blue">R</span>eact](https://react.dev/) is the UI framework in javascript.<br>
[<span style="color: dark-green">N</span>ode.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is the javascript runtime environment.

For the UI component and icon library I used [Material UI](https://mui.com/). <br>
For the Facebook login authentication I used [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth).<br>
