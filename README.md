# Odinbook

Odin Project's final project. The goal is to create facebook clone using javascript and the MERN stack. The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.JS. The assignment is listed on the [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-odin-book) website.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database.<br>
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) as the sever framework in javascript.<br>
[React](https://react.dev/) is the UI framework in javascript.<br>
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is the javascript runtime environment.

For the UI component and icon library I used [Material UI](https://mui.com/).
