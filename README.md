# odinbook

Odin Project's final project. This is a facebook clone using the MERN stack which consist of MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database.
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) as the sever framework in javascript.
[React](https://react.dev/) is the UI framework in javascript.
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is the javascript runtime environment.

For the UI component and icon library I used [Material UI](https://mui.com/).
